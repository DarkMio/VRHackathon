# VRHackathon
This repository contains our project **Clone Quest** from the **VRHackathon** at **MD.H** held by **VRBLN**.

## Aim of the game is to **Think Inverse** and solve quests with one or more clones as partner. The player is challenged by four really hard quests which kinda lead him to entangle his legs and arms to reach buttons, sliders and levers.

## Work will be continued asap. :pray: :video_game: :hanky: :heart:
